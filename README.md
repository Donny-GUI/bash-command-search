# bash-command-search :penguin: :flashlight: :shell:
Python script that searches all bash commands that are related to a word or words of your choice.

The word doesnt have to be a command name, it can be related to that word in some manner.

```Ex: list -> will list all the commands related to listing stuff.```


## Features :gem:

Will find commands by name :smile:. 

If __not__ found by *name* will print out commands **related** to the words you have used :sparkles: .

Searchs for all string variations of the word, uppercase, lowercase, allcaps etc.
